# Magic in the Middle Ages

Fabio Arciniegas' course notes from Coursera's University of Barcelona course available at https://www.coursera.org/learn/magic-middle-ages

Medieval European magic is a combination of Roman, Germanic, Judeo Christian and Islamic traditions.

# Ancient precedents

The term **Mageia** derives from zoroastric priests of persia, the Magoi from 5C BC. The earliest roman connotation, around 400 BC, is one of _difference_, and although it may be implied that it is dark and possibly dangerous, it is only with the shift to monotheism that we get the connotation of Mageia as the _opposite_ of right doctrine and superstition to be condemned.

## Magic and superstition in early christian europe

The legal ordinances of condemnation are telling because they inform us of the actual activities considered superstitions bad enough by the authorities to police. It is important to note at this point the authorities were not necessarily ecclisiastic. Many of the condemnations were self-organized by communities in councils. The ordinances include condemation of people for:

 - Divination of human fate - Divini or divinatores
 - Divination of weather    - Tempestari
 - Mediating with the dead  - Necromancers
 - Healing, dream intepretation etc - Magi or sortigeli in general
 
A classic example of an ordinance is that of 1310 in the diocese of Barcelona against a woman named Nadala, a divinatrix and sortilega (for she performed incantations with a strap and by carving symbols in the soil). For many years, even given ordinances, people would seek the help of divinatrices, conjuratrices, and sortilegas. It was only towards the end of medieval times that two forces would seriously start to change people's attitude towards magic: one renewed evangelization efforts by the church, and two the emergences of neo-scientific paradigms by medieval universities.

# Magic and heresy

The division of magic favored by medieval theologians was based on the power upon which the magic depended. Natural magic vs demonic magic. Of course, given monotheism the division was far from clear-cut.

Tatian, early Christian theologian of the 2C, condemns all sorts of magic in the Oratio ad Graecos. The basic idea is that amulets and herbs have no inherent power but instead they are infused of it by demons. 

Agustine of Hippo, in his classic Civitas Dei, is more nuanced as he condemns magic but acknowledges impressive natural powers such as magnets and the ability of certain plants/substances to cure people. He is suspicious of demons behind some of them.

Canon Law condemns magic as early as 306, where in a synod in the spanish town of Elvira it is stated that people who had killed others by maleficium were not to receive communion even in their own deathbeds.

In late christian rome, 439,  magic of all kinds became then a capital offense and several punishments appear in the Theodesian code and the Justinian code (529). 

The decline of the empire meant no central control, cultural change, and mixtures with pre-christian culture. The Middle ages would then see elements of pagan culture mixed with christianity in daily life and even doctrine. Natural magic enjoys a bit of a favorable period in the middle ages and flourishes particularly as disciplines such as astrology and alchemy blossom. This favorable,fluid situation will change, at least from the point of doctrine, as St. Thomas Aquinas concludes that all magic is undoubtedly related to the intervention of evil spirits.

## 12C and the rise of natural magic

During the early medieval times, natural magic enjoys a certain amount of freedom. Isidore of seville (550-663) speaks of divisions in natural magic: Geomancy, Hydromancy, Aeromancy, Pyromancy while Wiliam Arvogent (1180-1249), the patron saint of experimental sciences, writes about astrology and alchemy.

With the Summa against the gentile , his work addressing the "errors" of non-christian beliefs Saint Thomas Aquinas(1225-1274) puts a practica theological end to the division of natural vs demonic. It is all *superstitio*. 

In 1230 Inquisition starts. At the beginning this is not as evil as Torquemada and other typical figures we recognize today. The idea was to make _public inquisition_ rather than secret process and no appeal. Inquisitors such as Bernard Gui (from the Name of the Rose) were actually far more merciful than their fictional counterparts.

## Persecution unleashed

The inquisition starts officially on 1230 as a way for the holy church to penalize (and at least titularly regain the soul of) heretics. Note that in order to be a heretic you must be Christian. Muslims and Jews were not initially under the jurisdiction of the inquisition.  

Although the initial request for information or _inquisitio_ was public and people were encourage to denounce evil-doers, it was followed by secret process and no appeal.

Three interesting contrasts with public opinion regarding these trials are: (a) the majority of the initial accused were male and even priests who were accused of Necromancy, (b) the burning stake was really not the first option and in fact very careful deliberation did take place in many of these trials (a point already raised by GBS in his St Joan) and (c) that the accusations of sodomy, blood baths, and orgies were nothing new, in fact they had been the bread and butter of accusations at the begining of our era against a deviant and dangerous sect that would eventually change the world: Christianity.

## Not so evil inquisitors

Bernard de Gui, the inquisitor from the Name of the Rose, author of "Practica Inquisitionis Heretice Pravitatis" was a real life character who lived at the beginning of the 14th century. He took the post of Inquisitor of Toulouse in 1307, which he exercised for 18 years. During his tenure de Gui tried 600 people but only sent 10% to burn at the stake.  His book was _the_ manual for the next generation of inquisitors.

During the papacy of Alexander IV, clairvoyants and sorcerers were not brought before inquisitorial courts unless involved in heretical doctrise but under pope John XXII (~1320) the policy changed and everyone who made deals with or worshipped demons, modelled wax figures, desecrated the sacraments or divined the future were dealt with as heretics.

## When demons spoke latin

Necromancy at this point is almost exclusive to men. Nekros (dead body) + Manteia (prophecy, divination) requires complex and long incantations in latin. These incantations contain magic circles, conjurations, sacrifices, and are transmitted through books. Only clerics know how to read and write latin. Only wayward clerics can actually be Necromancers at this time.


# Jewish Magic

The context of Judaism as a tradition living inside non-jewish states is an important one to keep in mind. The Jewish people in the near east lived under the Dhimma (agreement of tolerance of non-muslims in a muslim state). 

The Rabbi as central figure of the religious and ethical education was the center of the aljama (jewish community) and in charge of the synagogue as house of study (bet midrash).

All jewish children education is based on the Tanakh (Torah, Mishnah, Talmud) as a basis not only for religious study but shared legends, stories, literature. The basic study comprises 18 years. The higher above that the better, but that usually would take more talent and resources. 

## Jewish idea of magic

The usual division of natural vs demonic magic applies here in the sense that natural magic (herbs, good fortune cleansing rites, etc) are not forbidden and in fact form part of daily services offered by Mekashef (also women Mekashefa) to the community. The notion of dark magic aided by deamons of course was forbidden by the Tanakh.

The Kabbalah, perhaps the most attractive and misunderstood part of the jewish tradition of magic has as its goal the understanding of God and His Creation through the enlightment that comes from reading the Torah. This is a Theosophical interpretation, where knowledge of God can be approximated by the spiritual ecstasy and direct intuition that comes from systematically approaching the holy text.

Of course all of this is very distant from new age rebranding of Kabbalah and the mysteries of the sepher yetzirah were something one would attempt to _begin_ delving into after 40 years of Tanakh study. 

# From Magic to Witchcraft

Witches, Streghe, Hexen, Sorcieres, Bruxas. The image of the malefica that is fixed in the western mind takes form and hold in the 15C. 

*The key mythologies of witchcraft are solidified in the 1400s. They consolidate elements and attributes of older mythological creatures, such as the Strigae, Lamiae, and Nightmare into a corporeal Witch which can fly, enter closed quarters, change shape, and indulge in infanticide.*

Perhaps not causal, but certainly representative is the role of Vincent Ferrer, the dominican priest and confessor called the Angel of the Last Judgement, who had, along with his jewish conversion activities, preached against all forms of magic. Soon after Ferrer's impassioned speeches in 1410s the hunt for witches would begin in earnest.

## The birth of the crime of Witchcraft

Before 1420 the division between natural and maleficent magic was the main concept. An important emphasis occurs after the description by Ferrer and others such as Pope Alexander V (1409) of _sects_ of diviners and invokers of demons bent on the diabolical _collectivity_ and common worship of the devil: The crime of Witchcraft merges diabolism and maleficent magic.

## The early witch mythologies

As mentioned before, the Strigae, Lamie, and Nightmare are the key precursors. They are perceived now not as spiritual or diabolical ideas but as corporeal beings. 

The notion of organization or evil group also gels into more tangible incarnations. For example the notion of the "good ladies" the Bonae Dominae, or Bonae Res, is prior to the 15C a somewhat abstract concept: nocturnal white lady figures capable of bringing both good or ill fortune, to be respected and feared by women of the house (leave them mirror and food). 

In the 1400s the trials start talking of these lady meetings as actual gatherings and women such as Sibilla and Pierina from Milan are accussed and convicted of interactiving with a sort of fairy society, meet together to dance and sing, worship a female figure in front of which the name of God could not be uttered. This was called Il Gioco, "the game." 

## Witchcraft trials

Sibilla and Pierina were convicted and burned in Milan in 1390. Similar cases in Barcelona and elsewhere start popping up. 

Trial by Iron: burn the hand, see how quickly it heals.

Notice that the majority of these trials were not started by the church but by the people and tried also by local authorities. A typical example is 1477 witch hunt of Mont-rós. Plagued by deaths of children and cattle they claim witchcraft, who are arrested and prosecuted by local court.

The mechanics are relatively simple: 
 - the accusation
 - followed by inquiries _inquisitio de vox et fama_ (not surprisingly the accused deny it)
 - The examination of marks (evidence of belonging to the sect), usually on the shoulders or back
 - Interlocutoria tormentorum. Interrogations but this time with the aid of judicial torture ( hanging by thumbs etc.) Naturally the confessions would happen here
 - Sentencing
 
Sample statement from 1471, Guillerma de Casala from the Pyrenean valley of Andorra, who after Interlocutoria tormentorum confesses she was introduced by another made Garreta and:

__"That the aforesaid Garreta has made her go to the he-goat. Because the aforesaid Garreta anointed her under the armpits and told her to say: 'Go up leaf!' And by that she found herself out of the house with the aforesaid Garreta. 

And so they went through the air to a mountain, whose name she doesn't remember, and there she saw a very big man named the Devil; and she saw around him 20 people, men and women, and some of them danced and others ate fruit. 

And then the Devil took her and told her to kiss his hand and so she did. 

And then she thinks that she kissed his buttocks and paid him homage and took him as her Lord, abjuring the Creator. And she promised him to do evil any time she could, and to never confess it, but to receive each year the Holy Communion instead. 

And so, being interrogated, she said that after that, the Devil had carnal intercourse with her. Interrogated, she said that he had a very cold member."__

The patterns in these confessions are telling of the common sources of the interrogators.

## Medieval codification of the stereotype

The characteristics mentioned (instant travel, transformation, infanticide, etc.) once codified are repeated and amplified. Some examples include:

 - Ambrosious de Vignate note on the prosecution of heresy (detailing the classics including intercourse with the devil)
 - The Flagellum Maleficorum (1460) by Petrus Mamoris (added the ability to stir up thunder and hailstorms)
 - Malleus Maleficarum (1487) reportedly by Wikipedia as the most popular and influential manual codifying the stereotype of witches. Note the female name
 - The Formicarius (1468), by Johannes Nider which focuses on the very witch-like theme of infanticide
 

# Magic in Islam

The division on Islam is slightly different. In the Muqaddima, Ibn Khaldun describes three degrees of magical ability:

 - Siḥr, or magic proper, which is exerted by those capable of it through sheer mental power
 - Ṭilasmāt, or talismans, which is exerted with the aid of the spheres and the elemetns, properties and numbers.
 - Prestidigitation, which exercises its influence upon the powers of imagination
 
Sihr can be executed by either prophets whose power comes from divine quality, or sorcerers deriving it from satanic forces. In this sense Islamic high and low magic roughly reconcile withthe traditional position between white and black or natural vs demonic magic.

Talismans (tilasm) from the greek word Telesta, involves inscriptions with a general astrological significance, use as charms.

Of course the division into three big categories is convenient and more direct than many classic sources. The classic example of variety is the 17 C Kashf al-zunun ("removal of doubts") which lists 14 disciplines under Sihr: divination, natural magic, properties of the Most Beautiful Names, of numbers, and of certain invocations, sympathetic magic, demoniacal conjurations, incantations, the evocations of spirits of corporeal beings, the invocation of the spirits of planets, phylacteries (amulets, talismans, philtres), the faculty of instantaneous disappearance from sight, artifices and fraud, the art of disclosing frauds, spells, and recourse to the properties of medicinal plants.

The reception of the practitioners was also more nuanced than the simple binary of permitted or not by the q'ran. In fact beneficial sorcerers were well regarded and respected in their communities for their impact on the crops and other services. This is a nuance that continues in communities to this day.

## The Science of Letters

The kabbalah is not the only art of letters. Ilm al-huruf, or symiya is the art of diviniation and incantation through the arabic letters.

The arabic alphabet is made only of consonants, so that the text is the flute and the reader the air that passes through it. This, coupled with the idea that the name of things is intrinsically tied to the true nature of things lends its character to the science to letters. There is a great deal of interpretation and experience in the correct approach to the science of words.

7 letters are hot, 7 cold, 7 dry 7 moist. Letters of the alphabet are also used as numberals. The combination and composition of a thing is reflected on its name and the science of the balance is one of the main areas of this type of Sihr.

al-asma al-husna, 99 names of god, are also an important preocupation and area of study.

## Alchemy

Not just argyropeia and chrysopeia (making of silver and gold respectively from baser substances). Al-kymiya also deals with refining salts, dyeing metals etc.

The fundamental idea of elixir theory is that since a thing is characterized by its proportions, a change in proportions will yield a change in nature. Reducing or enhancing the proportion in an entity you can change its nature to approximate the proportions of say, gold.

# Astrology and Geomancy

Medieval astrology is the perennial example of knowledge between science and magic.  Of course there was opposition to the idea, all the way back to ptolomey. but figures as late (and as famous) as Galileo Galilei and Tycho Brahe operated under the assumption that astrology, the study of the influence of celestial bodies over sublunary creatures (humans included) was a serious pursuit.

Influence of foreign elements in christian astrology are palpable including the lunar mansions, arabic terms for the brightest start in each segment of the sky, as well as many other items from World astrology dating back to zoroastrian millenialis, sassanian empire (last non-islamic persian from 13C) and cathartic astrology.

The Lunaria were a series of texts advicing on the appropriate times for selling/buying etc based on the moon. Zodiologies were highly folkloric reinterpretations of zodiacal signs with biblical alegories. They would keep the interest alive in merovingians and carolingians until the influx of islamic astrology in the 8C would bring higher dimensions to the dame with complex calculations and charts.

## Geomancy

The practice of divination through sand (geo, earth) comes from arabic manuals where it is called ilm al-raml (Sand Science).

```
. .      .     . .    .       etc.
. .     . .    . .   . .
. .     . .    . .    .
. .     . .     .    . .
```

the sixteen possible combinations of dots arranged in four rows of either one or two dots (4 bits) are called geomantic figures. Each given some meanings.

The usual practice is the creation of a chart made of 15 or 16 positions in which figures are placed.  

The first step is the random layout of four rows of dots, from which only one or two are left per row.

Then the operation is repeated four times in order to obtain four figures that will be called 'the mothers'. These are responsible for the rest by means of derivations: the first derivation is a transposition which produces 'the daughters.' The second law is 'additions' they add (xor?) two figures to produce a third one. 

Geomancy exhibits closed relationships with astrology. The positions in the chart are named houses and they are assigned typical roles or meaninings. 

It is assumed that Geomancy entered Europe after the translation of Arabic Handbooks in the 12 C. It has traveled with colonization as far as madagascar and the western african coast, the caribbean and the east, specially to pakistan and iran. In all these places it is still practiced.
