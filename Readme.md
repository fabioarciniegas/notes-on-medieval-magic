# Magic in the Middle Ages

Fabio Arciniegas' course notes from Coursera's University of Barcelona course available at https://www.coursera.org/learn/magic-middle-ages

Medieval European magic is a combination of Roman, Germanic, Judeo Christian and Islamic traditions.

# Ancient precedents

The term **Mageia** derives from zoroastric priests of persia, the Magoi from 5C BC. The earliest roman connotation, around 400 BC, is one of _difference_, and although it may be implied that it is dark and possibly dangerous, it is only with the shift to monotheism that we get the connotation of Mageia as the _opposite_ of right doctrine and superstition to be condemned.

## Magic and superstition in early christian europe

The legal ordinances of condemnation are telling because they inform us of the actual activities considered superstitions bad enough by the authorities to police. It is important to note at this point the authorities were not necessarily ecclisiastic. Many of the condemnations were self-organized by communities in councils. The ordinances include condemation of people for:

 - Divination of human fate - Divini or divinatores
 - Divination of weather    - Tempestari
 - Mediating with the dead  - Necromancers
 - Healing, dream intepretation etc - Magi or sortigeli in general
 
A classic example of an ordinance is that of 1310 in the diocese of Barcelona against a woman named Nadala, a divinatrix and sortilega (for she performed incantations with a strap and by carving symbols in the soil). For many years, even given ordinances, people would seek the help of divinatrices, conjuratrices, and sortilegas. It was only towards the end of medieval times that two forces would seriously start to change people's attitude towards magic: one renewed evangelization efforts by the church, and two the emergences of neo-scientific paradigms by medieval universities.

# Magic and heresy

The division of magic favored by medieval theologians was based on the power upon which the magic depended. Natural magic vs demonic magic. Of course, given monotheism the division was far from clear-cut.

Tatian, early Christian theologian of the 2C, condemns all sorts of magic in the Oratio ad Graecos. The basic idea is that amulets and herbs have no inherent power but instead they are infused of it by demons. 

Agustine of Hippo, in his classic Civitas Dei, is more nuanced as he condemns magic but acknowledges impressive natural powers such as magnets and the ability of certain plants/substances to cure people. He is suspicious of demons behind some of them.

Canon Law condemns magic as early as 306, where in a synod in the spanish town of Elvira it is stated that people who had killed others by maleficium were not to receive communion even in their own deathbeds.

In late christian rome, 439,  magic of all kinds became then a capital offense and several punishments appear in the Theodesian code and the Justinian code (529). 

The decline of the empire meant no central control, cultural change, and mixtures with pre-christian culture. The Middle ages would then see elements of pagan culture mixed with christianity in daily life and even doctrine. Natural magic enjoys a bit of a favorable period in the middle ages and flourishes particularly as disciplines such as astrology and alchemy blossom. This favorable,fluid situation will change, at least from the point of doctrine, as St. Thomas Aquinas concludes that all magic is undoubtedly related to the intervention of evil spirits.

## 12C and the rise of natural magic

During the early medieval times, natural magic enjoys a certain amount of freedom. Isidore of seville (550-663) speaks of divisions in natural magic: Geomancy, Hydromancy, Aeromancy, Pyromancy while Wiliam Arvogent (1180-1249), the patron saint of experimental sciences, writes about astrology and alchemy.

With the Summa against the gentile , his work addressing the "errors" of non-christian beliefs Saint Thomas Aquinas(1225-1274) puts a practica theological end to the division of natural vs demonic. It is all *superstitio*. 

In 1230 Inquisition starts. At the beginning this is not as evil as Torquemada and other typical figures we recognize today. The idea was to make _public inquisition_ rather than secret process and no appeal. Inquisitors such as Bernard Gui (from the Name of the Rose) were actually far more merciful than their fictional counterparts.

## Persecution unleashed

The inquisition starts officially on 1230 as a way for the holy church to penalize (and at least titularly regain the soul of) heretics. Note that in order to be a heretic you must be Christian. Muslims and Jews were not initially under the jurisdiction of the inquisition.  

Although the initial request for information or _inquisitio_ was public and people were encourage to denounce evil-doers, it was followed by secret process and no appeal.

Three interesting contrasts with public opinion regarding these trials are: (a) the majority of the initial accused were male and even priests who were accused of Necromancy, (b) the burning stake was really not the first option and in fact very careful deliberation did take place in many of these trials (a point already raised by GBS in his St Joan) and (c) that the accusations of sodomy, blood baths, and orgies were nothing new, in fact they had been the bread and butter of accusations at the begining of our era against a deviant and dangerous sect that would eventually change the world: Christianity.

## Not so evil inquisitors

Bernard de Gui, the inquisitor from the Name of the Rose, author of "Practica Inquisitionis Heretice Pravitatis" was a real life character who lived at the beginning of the 14th century. He took the post of Inquisitor of Toulouse in 1307, which he exercised for 18 years. During his tenure de Gui tried 600 people but only sent 10% to burn at the stake.  His book was _the_ manual for the next generation of inquisitors.

During the papacy of Alexander IV, clairvoyants and sorcerers were not brought before inquisitorial courts unless involved in heretical doctrise but under pope John XXII (~1320) the policy changed and everyone who made deals with or worshipped demons, modelled wax figures, desecrated the sacraments or divined the future were dealt with as heretics.

## When demons spoke latin

Necromancy at this point is almost exclusive to men. Nekros (dead body) + Manteia (prophecy, divination) requires complex and long incantations in latin. These incantations contain magic circles, conjurations, sacrifices, and are transmitted through books. Only clerics know how to read and write latin. Only wayward clerics can actually be Necromancers at this time.


# Jewish Magic

The context of Judaism as a tradition living inside non-jewish states is an important one to keep in mind. The Jewish people in the near east lived under the Dhimma (agreement of tolerance of non-muslims in a muslim state). 

The Rabbi as central figure of the religious and ethical education was the center of the aljama (jewish community) and in charge of the synagogue as house of study (bet midrash).

All jewish children education is based on the Tanakh (Torah, Mishnah, Talmud) as a basis not only for religious study but shared legends, stories, literature. The basic study comprises 18 years. The higher above that the better, but that usually would take more talent and resources. 

## Jewish idea of magic

The usual division of natural vs demonic magic applies here in the sense that natural magic (herbs, good fortune cleansing rites, etc) are not forbidden and in fact form part of daily services offered by Mekashef (also women Mekashefa) to the community. The notion of dark magic aided by deamons of course was forbidden by the Tanakh.

The Kabbalah, perhaps the most attractive and misunderstood part of the jewish tradition of magic has as its goal the understanding of God and His Creation through the enlightment that comes from reading the Torah. This is a Theosophical interpretation, where knowledge of God can be approximated by the spiritual ecstasy and direct intuition that comes from systematically approaching the holy text.
