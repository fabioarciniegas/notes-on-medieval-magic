# Magic in the Middle Ages

Course notes from Coursera's University of Barcelona course available at https://www.coursera.org/learn/magic-middle-ages

Medieval European magic is a combination of Roman, Germanic, Judeo Christian and Islamic traditions.

## Ancient precedents

The term **Mageia** derives from zoroastric priests of persia, the Magoi from 5C BC. The earliest roman connotation, around 400 BC, is one of _difference_, and although it may be implied that it is dark and possibly dangerous, it is only with the shift to monotheism that we get the connotation of Mageia as the _opposite_ of right doctrine and superstition to be condemned.

## Magic and superstition in early christian europe

The legal ordinances of condemnation are telling because they inform us of the actual activities considered superstitions bad enough by the authorities to police. It is important to note at this point the authorities were not necessarily ecclisiastic. Many of the condemnations were self-organized by communities in councils. The ordinances include condemation of people for:

 - Divination of human fate - Divini or divinatores
 - Divination of weather    - Tempestari
 - Mediating with the dead  - Necromancers
 - Healing, dream intepretation etc - Magi or sortigeli in general
 
A classic example of an ordinance is that of 1310 in the diocese of Barcelona against a woman named Nadala, a divinatrix and sortilega (for she performed incantations with a strap and by carving symbols in the soil). For many years, even given ordinances, people would seek the help of divinatrices, conjuratrices, and sortilegas. It was only towards the end of medieval times that two forces would seriously start to change people's attitude towards magic: one renewed evangelization efforts by the church, and two the emergences of neo-scientific paradigms by medieval universities.

## Magic and heresy

The division of magic favored by medieval theologians was based on the power upon which the magic depended. Natural magic vs demonic magic. Of course, given monotheism the division was far from clear-cut.

Tatian, early Christian theologian of the 2C, condemns all sorts of magic in the Oratio ad Graecos. The basic idea is that amulets and herbs have no inherent power but instead they are infused of it by demons. 

Agustine of Hippo, in his classic Civitas Dei, is more nuanced as he condemns magic but acknowledges impressive natural powers such as magnets and the ability of certain plants/substances to cure people. He is suspicious of demons behind some of them.

Canon Law condemns magic as early as 306, where in a synod in the spanish town of Elvira it is stated that people who had killed others by maleficium were not to receive communion even in their own deathbeds.

In late christian rome, 439,  magic of all kinds became then a capital offense and several punishments appear in the Theodesian code and the Justinian code (529). 

The decline of the empire meant no central control, cultural change, and mixtures with pre-christian culture. The Middle ages would then see elements of pagan culture mixed with christianity in daily life and even doctrine. Natural magic enjoys a bit of a favorable period in the middle ages and flourishes particularly as disciplines such as astrology and alchemy blossom. This favorable,fluid situation will change, at least from the point of doctrine, as St. Thomas Aquinas concludes that all magic is undoubtedly related to the intervention of evil spirits.

## 12C and the rise of natural magic

Isidore of seville (550-663) speaks of divisions in natural magic: Geomancy, Hydromancy, Aeromancy, Pyromancy.

In the 13C Wiliam Arvogent (1180-1249), the patron saint of experimental sciences writes about astrology and alchemy.
